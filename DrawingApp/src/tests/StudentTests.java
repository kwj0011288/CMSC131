	 * as you run public tests. If you need help from TAs you need

	 * experiencing.
	 * 
	 * Write your student tests as you develop your code (that is
	 * the correct approach).

	 * Notice that unless you add an appropriate assert statement,
	 * JUnit tests by default pass (generate a green color confirmation).
	 * To avoid you been mislead, we added an assertTrue(false).  Just
	 * focus on the actual output you see in the console, ignoring
	 * the confirmation color for your student tests.
